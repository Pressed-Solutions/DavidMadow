#Introduction
This repository is a Genesis child theme for DavidMadow.com. Iâ€™m converting it from a hacked v2.0.1 theme into a v2.1.2 child theme.

#Notes for Move to Production
 - Copy [theme customizations](http://new.davidmadow.com/wp-admin/customize.php)

#Notes for Client
 - To change content above the list of podcasts, simply [edit that page](http://new.davidmadow.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=864&action=edit)
 - To change the header image, go to [**Appearance** &gt; **Header**](http://new.davidmadow.com/wp-admin/themes.php?page=custom-header) and upload a new header. The size is hardcoded to 960x200px but could be made flexible if needed.
